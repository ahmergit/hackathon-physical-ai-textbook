# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 3 — AI & Humanoid Robots

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-11-29  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items passed on initial validation.
- Spec is ready for `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan` phase.
- No outstanding clarifications required — all requirements are clear and testable.
- Word count targets and structural requirements are explicitly defined in functional requirements.
- Reference URLs are specified for each lesson to ground content in 2025 research.
