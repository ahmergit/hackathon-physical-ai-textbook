### Section 1: Jobs and Work in a Robot World (~400 words)

#### H3 1.1: Will Robots Take Our Jobs?
- Valid concern: some jobs will change or disappear
- History: technology always changes work
- Factory workers, delivery drivers — real impact
- Be honest but not alarming

#### H3 1.2: New Jobs Robots Create
- Training and monitoring robots
- Designing and building robots
- New roles we can't imagine yet
- Reference: hiring demand across robotics, AI, engineering

#### H3 1.3: Working Together, Not Replacing
- Augmenting human capabilities
- Robots handle dangerous or boring tasks
- Humans focus on creativity and judgment
- Reference: "ensuring humans remain integral"

### Section 2: Privacy, Safety, and Trust (~400 words)

#### H3 2.1: Who Controls Robot Data?
- Robots with cameras and microphones
- Data about your home, family, health
- Privacy questions: who sees this information?
- Need for clear rules about data

#### H3 2.2: What If Robots Make Mistakes?
- Robots are not perfect
- Malfunctions can cause harm
- Reference: "Who is responsible if a humanoid malfunctions while caring for an elderly patient?"
- Importance of safety testing

#### H3 2.3: Building Trust with Technology
- Uncanny Valley: discomfort with almost-human robots
- Social acceptance takes time
- Need for transparency about what robots can/can't do
- Human control must remain

**Expert Insight #1** (place after Section 2):
```markdown
:::info Expert Insight: Balancing Progress and Safety
Technology's greatest promise is advancing human welfare — but we can't ignore the risks. Industry experts say robots navigating our homes and workplaces must follow social norms and behave predictably. This requires a team effort: engineers design technical safeguards, companies create safety protocols, and governments establish rules. Getting this balance right is essential for robots to truly help rather than harm.

```

### Section 3: Rules and Responsibility (~400 words)

#### H3 3.1: Why We Need Robot Rules
- No clear laws yet for many robot situations
- Different countries, different approaches
- Need for global standards
- Reference: EU AI regulations, safety certification

#### H3 3.2: Who Is Responsible?
- Robot hurts someone — who's to blame?
- The robot? The company? The owner?
- Legal frameworks still developing
- Accountability matters for trust

#### H3 3.3: Making Fair Decisions
- Robots shouldn't discriminate
- AI can have biases (from training data)
- Ensuring fairness for everyone
- Your voice matters in shaping these rules

**Expert Insight #2** (place after Section 3):
```markdown
:::info Expert Insight: Why Ethics Matter in Robotics
As robots enter sensitive roles — caring for children, helping elderly, making deliveries — we must think carefully about ethics. Questions like "Is it fair?" and "Who benefits?" are just as important as "Does it work?" The World Economic Forum emphasizes that both companies and individuals need clear guardrails to embrace robot technology responsibly. You can be part of this conversation!

### Summary (~50 words)
- Robot technology brings real challenges alongside benefits
- Jobs will change, but new opportunities will emerge
- Privacy, safety, and trust require careful thought
- Rules and responsibility must be figured out together
- Your generation will help shape these decisions
