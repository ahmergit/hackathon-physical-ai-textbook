:::info Expert Insight: Robots Helping Elderly Safely
As people live longer, there aren't enough caregivers to help everyone who needs it. Robots can fill this gap by being present when human helpers can't be. They can remind your grandmother to take her medicine, call for help if she falls, and even have conversations to reduce loneliness. Industry experts say robots with memory can remember past conversations, making them feel more like real companions.
