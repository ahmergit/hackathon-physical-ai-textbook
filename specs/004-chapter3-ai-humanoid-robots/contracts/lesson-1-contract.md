### Section 1: What Makes Humanoid Robots Special (~400 words)

#### H3 1.1: The Human-Like Shape
- Why robots shaped like humans are useful
- Navigate human environments (stairs, doors, tools)
- Work in spaces designed for people
- Analogy: "Imagine trying to use a vacuum cleaner-shaped robot to open a door..."

#### H3 1.2: Sensors and Balance
- How robots "see" and "feel" their environment
- Balance systems that keep them upright
- Compare to human senses
- Simple explanation of 360-degree perception

#### H3 1.3: AI Thinking and Learning
- Brain of the robot — artificial intelligence
- How AI helps robots make decisions
- Learning from experience (like learning to ride a bike)
- Real-time decision making

**Expert Insight #1** (place after Section 1):
```markdown
:::info Expert Insight: Why the Human-Like Form Helps Adaptation
Robots shaped like humans can use the same tools we use, walk through the same doors, and climb the same stairs. This makes them more useful in places designed for people — homes, offices, and hospitals were all built with human bodies in mind. It's easier to adapt a human-shaped robot to our world than to rebuild our world for robots.

### Section 2: Why Humanoid Robots Are Rising Now (~400 words)

#### H3 2.1: Better Motors and Cheaper Parts
- Technology improvements over past years
- Motors, actuators, batteries getting better
- Costs dropping — becoming affordable
- Reference: prices predicted to drop from $175K to $50K by 2050

#### H3 2.2: Powerful AI Breakthroughs
- AI revolution enabling smarter robots
- Machine learning, computer vision advances
- Robots can now learn and adapt
- Reference: Stanford AI Index shows US and China leading

#### H3 2.3: Growing Industry Interest
- Big companies investing heavily
- Tesla, Boston Dynamics, Figure AI
- $7.3 billion invested in H1 2025
- NVIDIA's humanoid robot showcase

**Expert Insight #2** (place after Section 2):
```markdown
:::info Expert Insight: Recent Breakthroughs Changing Everything
In 2025, humanoid robots competed in a Beijing half-marathon — 21 robots finished the 21-kilometer course! This wasn't possible just a few years ago. Better AI, stronger batteries, and smarter sensors mean robots can now do things we once thought only humans could do. Industry experts say we're at a turning point where robots move from research labs to real life.

### Section 3: Where Humanoid Robots Are Heading (~400 words)

#### H3 3.1: From Labs to Real Life
- Transition from experimental to operational
- Real deployments in factories (BMW, Mercedes)
- Moving into homes and hospitals
- Reference: "moving from hype to deployment"

#### H3 3.2: Companies Leading the Way
- Tesla Optimus — electric car company building robots
- Boston Dynamics Atlas — advanced mobility
- Agility Robotics, Figure AI — startup innovation
- PAL Robotics (20 years of experience)

#### H3 3.3: What the Future Holds
- Predictions: billions of robots by 2040
- One robot per 10 humans by 2050 (Morgan Stanley)
- Global market could exceed $5 trillion
- Optimistic but realistic outlook

### Summary (~50 words)
- Humanoid robots are special because of their shape, sensors, and AI
- 2025 breakthroughs are making them practical
- Big future ahead — but this is just the beginning
