## Source 1: McKinsey - "Work in the Future Will Be a Partnership"

**URL:** https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/work-in-the-future-will-be-a-partnership-between-people-agents-and-robots-all-powered-by-ai

### Key Findings

#### The Partnership Model
- "Work in the future will be a partnership between people, agents, and robots—all powered by AI"
- This represents a fundamental shift from replacement narrative to collaboration paradigm
- Three workforce entities: Humans, AI Agents, Physical Robots

#### Automation Potential
- **57% of US work hours** are theoretically automatable
- But automation ≠ job elimination; it means task reconfiguration
- **70%+ of skills** are used in both automatable and non-automatable work
- This overlap suggests humans will remain essential even in highly automated environments

#### Economic Impact
- **$2.9 trillion** potential economic value by 2030
- Value comes from productivity gains, new capabilities, and workforce augmentation

#### Skill Change Index
- McKinsey's measure of how quickly skills are evolving
- Indicates accelerating pace of change requiring continuous learning
- Both technical and human skills are transforming

#### Seven Workforce Archetypes
1. **Creators** - Innovation and design roles
2. **Servers** - Customer-facing service roles
3. **Crafters** - Skilled trade and production roles
4. **Providers** - Healthcare and education professionals
5. **Controllers** - Oversight and management roles
6. **Supporters** - Administrative and operational roles
7. **Technologists** - Technology development and maintenance

### Implications for Lessons
- **Lesson 1 (Partnership):** Core framework of human-agent-robot collaboration
- **Lesson 3 (Hybrid Roles):** Seven archetypes show how roles transform
- **Lesson 4 (Economic):** $2.9T value and 57% automation statistics

## Source 3: Brookings Institution - Automation and Workforce

**URL:** https://www.brookings.edu/articles/automation-and-artificial-intelligence-how-machines-affect-people-and-places/

### Key Findings

#### Regional and Demographic Impacts
- Automation affects different communities differently
- Geographic concentration of impact (manufacturing regions)
- Demographic variations in vulnerability:
  - Age factors
  - Education levels
  - Current industry employment

#### Task-Level Analysis
- Jobs are collections of tasks, not monolithic roles
- Some tasks within any job are more automatable than others
- This supports hybrid role evolution rather than wholesale replacement

#### Policy Framework
- Need for targeted interventions based on community impact
- Education and training investment critical
- Social safety net considerations
- Economic diversification strategies

### Implications for Lessons
- **Lesson 3 (Hybrid Roles):** Task-level automation analysis
- **Lesson 4 (Economic):** Regional and demographic disparities
- **Lesson 5 (Preparation):** Policy and education frameworks
