## Prompt

/sp.specify

Build a Docusaurus-based documentation website with a clean, consistent structure.

WHAT we are building:

A complete Docusaurus site structure (no content yet).

A homepage with hero section, tagline, CTA buttons, and feature blocks.

A documentation sidebar that displays chapters and lessons in a collapsible tree.

A main content layout that shows chapters in the center and automatically generates headings navigation on the right.

A global navbar with links to Home, Docs, GitHub, and future sections.

A footer with three columns: About, Resources, and Social links.

A fully responsive layout that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Automatic page routing for all docs pages generated by the folder structure.

Clean information architecture so book chapters → lessons → subpages map directly to folders.

WHY we are building it:

To create a professional, readable structure before generating book content later.

To ensure navigation is intuitive and consistent once chapters are added.

To allow readers to easily browse chapters from the left sidebar.

To give a polished user experience that mirrors high-quality technical docs.

To prepare a static site suitable for free hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages).

To finalize the structure early so all later content simply plugs into it.

Success criteria:

Sidebar correctly reflects the folder hierarchy (chapters → lessons).

Homepage is visually clean with hero, tagline, and feature sections.

Right-hand table-of-contents updates automatically based on headings.

Navbar and footer are present on all pages.

All pages load fast and compile successfully using Docusaurus defaults.

Responsive design works across all devices without layout breaking.

No placeholder or repeated text—structure only.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification for Docusaurus-based documentation website structure.

**Specification Summary:**

**Core Requirements (9 Functional Requirements):**
1. Docusaurus 3.9.2 installation with TypeScript support
2. Homepage with hero section, tagline, CTA buttons, and feature highlights
3. Documentation sidebar with auto-generated collapsible chapter/lesson tree navigation
4. Main content layout with centered content and right-side auto-generated TOC
5. Global navbar with Home, Docs, GitHub links
6. Footer with three columns (About, Resources, Social)
7. Fully responsive layout (mobile-first, 320px+ screens)
8. Automatic page routing based on folder structure
9. Clean information architecture: chapters → lessons → subpages

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Performance: Build < 60s, load < 2s, Lighthouse > 90
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Browser compatibility: Modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
- Deployment readiness for GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel

**Technology Stack:**
- Docusaurus 3.9.2 (static site generator)
- React 18+ (frontend framework)
- TypeScript 5.x (type safety)
- Node.js 18+ with npm/yarn
- CSS Modules for custom styling

**Project Structure:**
```
docs/                          # Documentation content
  intro.md                     # Landing page
  chapter-##-name/             # Chapter folders
    _category_.json            # Chapter metadata
    lesson-##-name.md          # Lesson files
src/
  pages/
    index.tsx                  # Homepage
  css/
    custom.css                 # Custom styling
static/                        # Static assets
docusaurus.config.ts           # Main configuration
sidebars.ts                    # Sidebar configuration
package.json                   # Dependencies
```

**Key Features:**
- Auto-generated sidebar from folder structure
- Responsive hero section with gradient background
- Three-column footer with links
- Auto-generated TOC from markdown headings
- Clean folder naming convention for chapters and lessons
- Semantic versioning and deployment pipeline
- Comprehensive testing strategy (build, visual, accessibility, performance)

**Success Metrics:**
- All 9 functional requirements met
- Lighthouse Performance > 90
- Build time < 60 seconds
- Mobile-responsive on 320px+ screens
- No placeholder text or broken links

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete, production-ready specification for Docusaurus site structure created. Covers all functional/non-functional requirements, technical architecture, data models, testing strategy, and deployment plan.
- 🧪 Tests: Specification phase - no tests yet. Testing strategy defined in spec (build testing, visual testing, accessibility, performance).
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/docusaurus-site-structure/spec.md` (comprehensive specification document ~700 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.plan` to create architectural plan and design artifacts for implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification aligns with constitution principles (spec-driven development, automation-first, type safety, performance targets). All requirements traceable to user success criteria. Ready for planning phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification complete and compliant with constitution
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual review - PASS (all sections complete, requirements clear and testable)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to `/sp.plan` to design implementation architecture
